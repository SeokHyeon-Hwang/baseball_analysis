## Purpose
Using team data for the season of 2016,
I tested the correlation between Hit and Run Scored.

### Result
```{r echo=FALSE, warning=false}
library(Lahman)
dat<-subset(Teams, yearID==2016, select=c(R,H))
```

Correlation coefficient is 'r cor(dat$R, dat$H)'.

## Findings
I found a positive relationship between the two variables.

### Scatterplot
* I plotted the relationship.

```{r echo=False}
plot(dat$H, dat$R)
```
